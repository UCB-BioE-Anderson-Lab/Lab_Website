# Teaching

The Anderson Lab plays a central role in teaching synthetic biology at UC Berkeley, with course offerings that integrate wetlab skills, computational tools, and real-world project experience. The following are core instructional efforts led by Prof. J. Christopher Anderson:

## Online Cloning Tutorials

To support teaching in synthetic biology, the Anderson Lab offers a structured set of interactive tutorials for BioE 140L students, iGEM members, and others interested in molecular biology. This guided resource features explanatory text, embedded videos, and scored quizzes. It is designed to support diverse entry points and build a strong foundation in core technologies.

The tutorials cover:

- Designing primers and oligos
- Planning and running wetlab experiments
- DNA construction and plasmid visualization
- In-depth technical overviews of modern synthetic biology methods

## BioE 140L: Synthetic Biology Laboratory

**Semester**: Fall  
**Units**: 4  
**Format**: 2 hours lecture + 6 hours lab per week  
**Prerequisites**: BioE11 or Bio1A  

**About the Course**  
BioE 140L is a project-based lab course that introduces students to the tools and mindset of synthetic biology. You'll learn how to design and run cloning experiments, select assays, and interpret experimental results. The course centers on real research projects, giving you a close-up view of how synthetic biology is practiced in the lab, even if you’ve never pipetted before.

**Why Take It?**  
This course is for students who want a deeper, more applied experience with molecular biology. It’s designed to get you thinking like an experimentalist: how to design, troubleshoot, and iterate on experiments in a real research context.

**What You’ll Take Away**:

- Practical skills in cloning, assay planning, and wetlab workflows  
- Confidence designing experiments from scratch  
- First-hand insight into how synthetic biology research is structured and executed  
- A foundation for working in research labs or pursuing more advanced biotech coursework  

## BioE 134 (Undergrad) / 234 (Grad): Biodesign Automation

**Semester**: Spring  
**Units**: 4  
**Format**: 3 hours lecture + 1 hour discussion per week  
**Prerequisites**: CS 61A or E7, and BioE11 or Bio1A  

**About the Course**  
Biodesign Automation is a hands-on coding course focused on applying computer science to real problems in synthetic biology. Students build original Python-based tools—rather than using existing platforms—to automate tasks like cloning, gene design, and biosynthetic pathway construction. The course helps students connect their biology and chemistry background with programming skills, using platforms like Google Colab and GitHub. Students are introduced to language models such as ChatGPT to assist with coding, and explore both the current landscape of biodesign software and the areas where new tools are still needed.

**Why Take It?**  
This course is for students who want to gain real programming experience while working on meaningful biology problems. It emphasizes integration: combining biological insight with computational thinking, and building tools that reflect the needs and workflows of experimental biologists. Through a mix of structured assignments and a culminating team project, students learn how to turn scientific ideas into functioning software.

**What You’ll Take Away**:

- Practical coding skills applied to synthetic biology  
- Experience designing and automating genetic engineering workflows  
- Use of large language models like ChatGPT for coding and design  
- Awareness of current tools and open challenges in biodesign automation  
- A final project developing software tools that integrate biology and computation

## Undergraduate iGEM Program  
[Learn more → igem.studentorg.berkeley.edu/about](https://igem.studentorg.berkeley.edu/about)

UC Berkeley’s iGEM team is the campus’s primary community for hands-on genetic engineering research by undergraduates. Supported by the Anderson Lab, the program gives students the opportunity to design and carry out their own research in synthetic biology, from initial idea to public presentation.

The program is structured to support students at every level. New members enter through the Foundations of Engineering Biology (FERB) course sequence, which builds the wetlab and computational skills needed to engage in real research. From there, students join self-directed project teams focused on original, student-proposed synthetic biology questions. Teams receive mentorship from faculty, grad students, and experienced student leaders, and meet regularly to plan and execute experiments.

**What Makes iGEM at Berkeley Unique**:

- Open to all undergraduates—no experience required  
- Emphasizes project ownership, collaboration, and mentorship  
- Supports both experimental and computational biology pathways  
- Offers one of the largest and most diverse research training pipelines in the college  
- Concludes with team presentations at the Bay Area Bioengineering Symposium (BABS)  
- Includes research that has led to publication, such as: Lim et al., "Interpreting biochemical text with language models" (2025) [bioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.15.654376v1)
