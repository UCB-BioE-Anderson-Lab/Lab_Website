    <h2>About the Lab</h2>
    <p>
      Our research focuses on building tools that help us reason about and control biology. We develop software to support genetic design and biochemical modeling, engineer therapeutic microbes as long-term goals, and prototype new approaches to DNA fabrication and biocontainment. The common thread is turning biological systems into things we can test, predict, and trust.

    A lot of our work starts with a simple but difficult question: how do we know whether a genetic design or experimental plan will actually work? In synthetic biology, you're often stitching together pieces from different systems. You're introducing foreign genes and making new molecules. It’s easy to draw a pathway on paper, but much harder to know how that design will behave once it hits a living system.

    This question has followed us through a range of projects. Early on, we worked on incorporating unnatural amino acids into proteins. It worked well, but also showed us how unpredictable cell metabolism can be. For example, we saw alpha-hydroxy acids getting consumed in unexpected ways. Later, efforts to program bacteria for therapeutic delivery ran into a different kind of complexity: too many variables, and no good tools for reasoning through them. That experience shifted our focus. If we want to do ambitious things with biology, we need to understand where designs break, and why.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our current research is building that kind of understanding. We’re developing software that can simulate DNA assembly plans, check for errors, and predict outcomes. We’re modeling enzyme reactions in ways that preserve chemical logic, so we can spot off-pathway products or mechanistic mismatches. And we’re working toward systems that make experimental knowledge accessible to automation. Not just as data, but as something a computer can use to reason and decide. The long-term goal is to build a more fluent interface between ideas and experiments.

      <h2>Recent Highlights</h2>
      <p>Our recent work has focused on creating software tools that support synthetic biology by improving how we model and reason about biological systems:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>EVODEX is a system for representing enzymatic reactions in a way that captures chemical logic and allows for prediction and analysis.</li>
        <li>The Construction File Simulator (CFS) models DNA assembly protocols and helps identify potential design errors before they reach the lab.</li>
        <li>CHERMIT is a tool for mining and organizing chemical literature to make biochemical knowledge more accessible to automated systems.</li>
        <li>Our work has also led to technologies commercialized through Synvivia, 20n, and Ambrx.</li>
      </ul>
